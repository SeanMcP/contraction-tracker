# Contraction Tracker

🤰 A simple way to keep track of your contractions during labor

## Reasoning

When my wife went into labor with our first child, she was using a contraction tracker that was included in a pregnancy suite app on her phone. Through those hours, the app's tracker was helpful but was missing some pretty critical features.

Contraction Tracker seeks to remedy that situation by including a full set of features that pregnant women and their partners need during the excitement of labor.
