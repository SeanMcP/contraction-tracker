# Contraction Tracker

A simple way to keep track of your contractions during labor

## Reasoning

When my wife went into labor with our first child, she was using a contraction tracker that was included in a pregnancy suite app on her phone. Through those exciting hours, the app's tracker was helpful but was missing some pretty critical features.

Contraction Tracker seeks to remedy that situation by including a full set of features that pregnant women and their partners need during the excitement of labor.
